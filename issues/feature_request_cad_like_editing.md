### Feature Request: CAD-like Web Page Editing

#### Description
I would like to suggest adding features to allow users to edit web pages similarly to CAD software. The following functionalities would greatly enhance the user experience:

1. **File Movement:** Allow users to move files to specific page coordinates easily, akin to how elements can be positioned in CAD software.
2. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Implement drag-and-drop capabilities enabling users to position elements more intuitively.
3. **Color Selection:** Introduce a regulated palette for picking colors, as well as an eyedropper tool for users to select colors from anywhere on the page easily.

These features would contribute to a more interactive and user-friendly editing experience, making web page design more accessible and intuitive.

Thank you for considering this feature request!
