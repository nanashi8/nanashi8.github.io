### Proposal: Enhancing Visual Design Editing Features

To improve the user experience for designing web pages in this repository, I propose introducing highly interactive and visual editing capabilities. 

#### Key Features to Implement:
1. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Allow users to position buttons, cards, and other components easily within an editor view. 
2. **Predefined Styles**: Provide a library of preset shapes and components that adhere to consistent design guidelines. 
3. **Bi-Directional Editing**: Changes made visually should automatically update the underlying code and vice versa, promoting a seamless workflow. 
4. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Include version control or snapshot-based navigation within the editor to allow easy reversals of changes.

With these improvements, creating functional and visually consistent web pages will become not only efficient but more accessible for contributors.

Looking forward to feedback or additional suggestions to refine this proposal.
