In our city, we have a good zoo, Smile Zoo.
The zoo has some interesting events.
Let's visit the zoo together next Sunday.
Good!
I love elephants.
Are there any events with the elephants?
Yes.
This is flyer of the zoo.
Look.
We can give food to them.
Oh, that's wonderful.
It will start at eleven in the morning, and we can enjoy it for thirty minutes.
I'm looking forward to the event!
Well, I want to watch some animal families.
Me, too.
Well, the zoo has two events to do that.
Right, but I can't join Night Safari because I have to go home by six.
OK.
Then, let's join watching Pandas .
Oh, look.
We should take our student ID cards to the zoo and show them to tha staff.
Yes.
We are fifteen years old.
So, if we do that, our entrance fee will be three dollars per person.
That's great.
By the way, I have a question.
How will we go there ?
By bus.
We'll take abus at the bus stop in front of our school at eight.
So, let's meet there at seven fifty in the morning.
