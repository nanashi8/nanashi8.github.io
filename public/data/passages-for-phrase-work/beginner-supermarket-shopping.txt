Every Saturday morning,

my mother and I go

to the supermarket.

We usually arrive at 9 a.m.

because it is not too crowded.

My mother makes a list

before we leave home.

She writes down everything we need for the week.

When we enter the supermarket,

we take a cart.

Sometimes the wheels make noise,

but we find a good one.

The supermarket is very big.

There are many aisles with different products.

My mother knows

where everything is

because we come here every week.

First, we go

to the fruit and vegetable section.

My mother is very careful

when she chooses vegetables.

She checks

if the lettuce is fresh and

if the tomatoes are ripe.

She also buys carrots, cucumbers, and potatoes.

I like

to help her pick apples and oranges.

Sometimes we buy watermelon in summer or pumpkins in autumn.

My mother always says vegetables are good for our health.

They contain vitamins

that help our bodies grow strong.

She tells me

to eat a variety of colorful vegetables every day.

Next, we go to the meat counter.

There is a butcher who cuts the meat.

My mother usually buys chicken, beef, or pork.

Sometimes she asks the butcher

to slice the meat into thin pieces.

The butcher is very friendly and always smiles.

After the meat section,

we visit the fish counter.

My father loves salmon,

so we buy it almost every week.

The fish always looks fresh

because the supermarket gets new fish every morning.

My mother checks carefully

to make sure the fish has clear eyes and does not smell bad.

The smell from the bakery is wonderful!

Fresh bread is baked every morning.

We usually buy a loaf of bread for breakfast.

Sometimes my mother lets me choose cookies or a sweet roll.

The baker shows us different types of bread—white bread,

wheat bread,

and special bread with seeds.

My mother explains

that bread is made from flour,

water, and yeast.

The dough needs time

to rise

before it can be baked in the oven.

I want

to try making bread at home someday.

We always stop at the dairy section.

My mother buys milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt.

She reads the labels carefully

to check the dates.

Fresh dairy products are important for healthy bones.

My little sister drinks a lot of milk

because she wants

to grow tall.

Sometimes we buy cream to make desserts.

My mother likes

to bake cakes on special occasions.

She uses eggs, flour, sugar,

and butter

to make delicious sweets.

In the middle aisles,

there are many canned and packaged foods.

We buy rice, pasta, cereal, and canned vegetables.

My mother also picks up spices like salt, pepper,

and other seasonings.

She uses these

to add flavor

to our meals.

There is also a large selection of sauces and jams.

We buy tomato sauce for pasta and strawberry jam for toast.

My brother loves peanut butter,

so we always have a jar at home.

The beverage aisle has many choices.

We buy juice, tea,

and sometimes soda for special occasions.

My mother prefers natural juice without added sugar.

She says too much sugar is not good for our teeth.

We also buy bottled water.

My mother puts it in the refrigerator so we always have cold water

to drink.

In summer,

we drink more water

because of the hot weather.

The frozen food section is very cold!

We walk quickly through this area.

My mother sometimes buys frozen vegetables or ice cream.

Frozen foods can last a long time

because the low temperature preserves them.

My favorite part is choosing ice cream flavors.

There are so many types—vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,

and many others.

My mother says we can only buy ice cream

if we eat all our vegetables

during the week.

Near the checkout,

there are shelves with snacks and candy.

My brother and I always look at these items.

My mother sometimes allows us

to choose one small treat

if we have been helpful

during shopping.

We try

to choose wisely

because we cannot buy everything we want.

When we finish shopping,

we go

to the checkout counter.

The cashier scans all our items.

My mother pays with cash or a credit card.

The cashier gives us a receipt

that shows everything we bought and how much we spent.

Sometimes there is a long line at the checkout,

especially on Saturday mornings.

We wait patiently and talk

about what we will cook for dinner.

My mother plans our meals based on what we bought.

After paying,

we push our cart

to the parking lot.

We put all the grocery bags in the trunk of our car.

The bags are heavy,

so I help my mother carry them.

Some bags have fragile items like eggs or glass bottles,

so we must be careful.

When we arrive home,

everyone helps bring the bags inside.

We put the frozen foods in the freezer first so they do not melt.

Then we organize everything—vegetables in the refrigerator,

canned goods in the cupboard,

and bread in the bread box.

My mother is always tired

after shopping,

but she feels satisfied.

She knows we have enough food for the whole week.

Shopping at the supermarket is a lot of work,

but it is also a good time for our family

to spend together.

Sometimes shopping is more complicated than usual.

Last month,

the supermarket was very crowded

because there was a big sale.

The announcement said all dairy products were twenty percent off.

My mother was eager

to take advantage of this offer,

but we had

to wait in a lengthy queue.

Although waiting was tedious,

we saved a considerable amount of money.

During holiday seasons, the supermarket displays special decorations.

In December,

they hang shiny ornaments and play cheerful music.

The atmosphere becomes festive and lively.

The staff members wear festive uniforms with red accessories.

Many shoppers purchase turkeys for their holiday feasts.

The bakery section offers specialty items like gingerbread cookies and fruit cakes.

On occasion, we encounter unexpected situations.

Once, the elevator was broken,

so we had

to use the stairs

to reach the upper parking level.

The climb was tiring, especially

while carrying heavy bags.

Another time,

the automatic doors malfunctioned and wouldn't open properly.

A technician came quickly to repair them.

These minor incidents remind us

that even routine activities can have unforeseen challenges.

The supermarket is an excellent place

to learn

about nutrition and health.

Many packages display information

about calories, vitamins,

and other nutrients.

My mother teaches me

to read these labels carefully.

Some products claim

to be "natural" or "organic," but we must verify these claims by examining the ingredients list.

I've learned

that advertisers use clever techniques

to make products seem appealing.

Colorful packaging and persuasive slogans attract customers' attention.

However, we shouldn't let attractive packaging influence our decisions.

My mother advises me

to compare prices and quality rather than judging items solely by their appearance.

The supermarket also sells non-food items.

We sometimes purchase cleaning supplies,

paper towels,

and personal care products.

These aisles contain items like shampoo, soap,

toothpaste, and bandages.

My mother prefers

to buy all our household necessities in one trip

to save time and effort.

The supermarket's inventory changes with the seasons.

In spring, fresh strawberries and asparagus appear.

Summer brings an abundance of melons,

berries, and corn.

Autumn offers squash, pumpkins, and apples.

Winter features citrus fruits and root vegetables.

This variety ensures we can enjoy diverse,

seasonal produce

throughout the year.

My mother explains

that buying seasonal fruits and vegetables is both economical and environmentally responsible.

Seasonal produce travels shorter distances,

reducing fuel consumption and pollution.

It also tastes better

because it's harvested at peak ripeness rather than being picked early for long-distance shipping.

The supermarket sometimes displays promotional signs encouraging customers

to try new products.

These promotions include free samples of cheese,

juice, or snacks.

My brother and I enjoy tasting these samples,

though my mother reminds us

that we should only accept samples of items we might actually purchase.

Shopping on a budget requires careful planning.

My mother allocates a specific amount of money for groceries each week.

She calculates prices mentally and keeps track of our spending.

If we exceed our budget,

she puts back non-essential items.

This discipline ensures we don't waste money on unnecessary purchases.

Sometimes we use coupons to save money.

My mother clips coupons from newspapers and checks for digital coupons on her phone.

These small savings accumulate over time.

She says

that being a smart shopper means finding ways

to stretch our budget

without sacrificing quality or nutrition.

The supermarket's loyalty program offers additional savings.

Members earn points with each purchase,

which can be redeemed for discounts on future shopping trips.

My mother registered for this program,

and we've saved a substantial amount over the months.

She checks the app regularly for exclusive member deals and personalized offers.

The supermarket is more than just a place

to buy food—it's a community gathering spot.

We often encounter neighbors and acquaintances while shopping.

People exchange greetings,

share recipe ideas,

or discuss local events.

These casual conversations strengthen community bonds.

The supermarket employs many local residents.

The teenage son of our neighbor works

as a cashier on weekends.

My mother's former classmate manages the bakery section.

Supporting the supermarket means supporting our community members' livelihoods.

This connection makes shopping feel more meaningful.

The supermarket also participates in charitable activities.

They collect donations for the local food bank,

helping families

who struggle

to afford adequate nutrition.

During the holidays, they organize food drives.

My mother always contributes something to these causes.

She says

that helping others is an important value our family cherishes.

Shopping at the supermarket has taught me many things.

I learned

about different types of food and

where they come from.

I also learned

to read labels and compare prices.

My mother says these are important skills for adult life.

I've discovered

that shopping involves more than simply grabbing items off shelves.

It requires planning, budgeting,

decision-making,

and sometimes patience.

These lessons

about responsibility, discipline,

and wise resource management will serve me well

throughout my life.

Most importantly, I learned not to waste food.

My mother always says we should be grateful for what we have.

Many people in the world do not have enough food

to eat.

We should buy only what we need and use everything we buy.

Every purchase we make has broader implications—environmental,

economic, and social.

Understanding where our food comes from and how it reaches us creates appreciation for the farmers,

truck drivers,

warehouse workers,

and store employees

who make our meals possible.

This awareness fosters gratitude and respect for the entire food supply system.

I am glad I can help my family with shopping.

It makes me feel grown up and responsible.

These weekly trips have transformed from simple errands into valuable learning experiences.

Maybe when I am older,

I will do the shopping by myself,

applying all the wisdom my mother has shared with me!
