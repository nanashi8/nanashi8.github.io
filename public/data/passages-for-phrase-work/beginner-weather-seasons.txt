Weather affects our daily lives in many ways.

Sometimes it is sunny and warm,

and sometimes it is rainy and cold.

Learning about weather helps us prepare for each day.

We can dress appropriately and plan our activities according

to the forecast.

Spring arrives after the cold winter.

The temperature starts

to rise,

and the weather becomes warmer each day.

The ice and snow from winter begin

to melt.

This melted water helps plants grow.

In spring,

we can see many changes in nature.

Trees that looked dead

during winter suddenly come alive.

New leaves appear on the branches.

Flowers bloom in gardens and parks.

The landscape transforms from brown and gray

to green and colorful.

Spring weather can be unpredictable.

Some days are warm and sunny,

while others are cool and rainy.

We often have showers

that help the plants grow.

After a rain shower,

sometimes we can see a beautiful rainbow in the sky.

The rainbow appears

when sunlight shines

through water drops in the atmosphere.

The mornings in spring can be quite chilly,

but by afternoon it gets warm.

The sunrise comes earlier each day,

and the sunset comes later.

We have more hours of sunshine,

which makes people feel happier and more energetic.

Spring winds can be strong sometimes.

The breeze blows

through the trees and makes the new leaves dance.

These winds help spread seeds

to new places

where they can grow into new plants.

Summer is the hottest season of the year.

The sun shines brightly in the clear blue sky.

The temperature rises very high, especially during midday.

On hot summer days,

the heat can be intense.

People wear light clothes in summer

because of the warm weather.

We also drink more water

to stay cool and healthy.

The long,

sunny days are perfect for outdoor activities like swimming,

hiking, and camping.

Summer usually has less rain than spring, but

when it does rain,

the storms can be powerful.

Thunder and lightning often accompany summer storms.

The thunder makes loud noises

that can be frightening,

but it is just the sound of the atmosphere heating up rapidly.

Lightning is a flash of electricity in the sky.

It happens

when clouds become charged with electrical energy.

We should stay indoors

during lightning storms

because lightning can be dangerous.

Sometimes summer brings very dry weather.

If there is no rain for a long time,

we call it a drought.

During a drought,

plants cannot get enough moisture,

and rivers and lakes may dry up.

Farmers worry

about droughts

because their crops need water

to grow.

The summer sun rises very early,

around 5 a.m.,

and sets late,

around 8 p.m.

These long days give us plenty of time

to enjoy outdoor activities.

However, we must be careful

about too much sun exposure.

The sun's rays can burn our skin,

so we should wear sunscreen and hats.

On very humid days,

the air feels heavy and sticky.

Humidity means there is a lot of moisture in the air.

High humidity can make hot weather feel even hotter.

Some days are so humid

that we can see mist in the early morning.

Autumn, also called fall, comes after summer.

The weather starts to cool down gradually.

The temperature drops,

and we need

to wear warmer clothes.

The hot summer days are replaced by comfortable, mild weather.

Autumn is famous for its beautiful colors.

The leaves on trees change from green

to yellow, orange,

red, and brown.

This happens because the trees prepare for winter.

They stop making the green substance

that helps them catch sunlight.

Without this green color,

we can see the other beautiful colors

that were hidden.

The weather in autumn is often very pleasant.

We have many clear,

sunny days with blue skies.

The sunshine is not

as intense

as in summer,

making it comfortable

to spend time outside.

The nights become longer,

and the sunrise comes later each morning.

Sometimes autumn brings fog in the early morning.

Fog is like a cloud

that touches the ground.

It makes everything look mysterious and soft.

As the sun rises and warms the air,

the fog usually disappears.

Autumn winds can be quite strong.

The breeze blows the colorful leaves off the trees.

Children love

to jump in piles of fallen leaves.

The wind also helps spread seeds and prepares nature for the coming winter.

As autumn progresses,

we notice the days getting shorter.

The sunset comes earlier each evening.

The twilight period

between day and night becomes more noticeable.

The air feels crisp and fresh,

especially in the morning and evening.

Winter is the coldest season.

The temperature can drop below freezing,

which means water turns into ice.

In many places,

snow falls from the clouds and covers the ground with a white blanket.

Snowflakes are tiny ice crystals

that form in cold clouds.

Each snowflake has a unique shape.

When many snowflakes fall together,

we call it snow.

Children love

to play in the snow,

building snowmen and having snowball fights.

Winter weather can be harsh and challenging.

The cold temperature makes us wear heavy coats, hats,

gloves, and scarves.

We need

to keep our bodies warm

to stay healthy.

Ice forms when water freezes.

Ice can be beautiful,

making tree branches sparkle in the sunlight.

However, ice on roads and sidewalks can be dangerous

because it is very slippery.

People must walk carefully to avoid falling.

Frost appears on windows and plants on very cold mornings.

Frost is a thin layer of ice crystals

that forms

when moisture in the air freezes.

It creates beautiful patterns on glass windows.

The wind in winter can be bitter and harsh.

When strong winds combine with cold temperatures and snow,

we call it a blizzard.

During a blizzard,

it is difficult

to see anything

because the wind blows snow everywhere.

People should stay indoors during blizzards for safety.

Winter days are short.

The sun rises late and sets early.

In some northern regions,

there are only a few hours of daylight.

The sunrise might not happen

until 8 a.m.,

and the sunset could come

as early

as 4 p.m.

The winter sky is often gray and cloudy.

Clouds form

when moisture in the cold air condenses.

These clouds can bring snow or freezing rain.

Freezing rain is particularly dangerous

because it creates a layer of ice on everything it touches.

Despite the cold, winter has its own beauty.

The landscape covered in snow looks peaceful and clean.

The bare tree branches create interesting patterns against the sky.

The moon and stars seem brighter in the cold,

clear winter nights.

Sometimes we experience extreme weather

that is unusual or dangerous.

A hurricane is a huge storm with very strong winds and heavy rain.

Hurricanes form over warm ocean water and can cause severe damage

when they hit land.

A tornado is a violent spinning column of air

that extends from a storm cloud

to the ground.

Tornadoes can destroy buildings and uproot trees.

They are very dangerous and frightening.

An avalanche happens in mountain areas

when a large amount of snow suddenly slides down the slope.

Avalanches can bury everything in their path.

People who enjoy winter sports in mountains must be aware of avalanche danger.

Floods occur

when too much rain falls in a short time, or

when ice and snow melt too quickly.

The water overflows from rivers and covers land

that is normally dry.

Floods can damage homes and crops.

Meteorologists are scientists who study and predict weather.

They use special equipment

to measure temperature, humidity,

wind speed,

and air pressure.

This information helps them create weather forecasts.

A weather forecast tells us what kind of weather

to expect in the coming days.

The forecast might say it will be sunny, cloudy,

rainy, or snowy.

It also predicts the temperature and wind conditions.

Modern weather forecasts are quite accurate

because meteorologists use satellites and computers.

Satellites orbit the Earth and take pictures of clouds and weather patterns from space.

This helps scientists see large weather systems and track storms.

Weather influences what we wear each day.

On sunny days,

we might wear light clothes and sunglasses.

On rainy days,

we need an umbrella and waterproof jacket.

In cold weather,

we bundle up in warm clothes.

Weather also affects our mood and energy.

Sunny weather tends

to make people feel happy and active.

Cloudy, rainy weather might make some people feel sleepy or sad.

This is normal and happens to many people.

Farmers depend heavily on weather.

They need the right amount of rain and sunshine for their crops

to grow.

Too much rain can flood the fields,

while too little rain causes drought.

The right weather at the right time is essential for a good harvest.

Weather determines what outdoor activities we can enjoy.

Swimming is fun in sunny, warm weather.

Skiing and ice skating require cold weather and snow.

Hiking is pleasant

when the weather is mild and not too hot or cold.

Meteorologists are scientists

who study weather patterns and make forecasts.

They use sophisticated instruments

to measure temperature, humidity,

wind speed,

air pressure,

and other conditions.

Satellites orbiting Earth provide images showing cloud formations and storm systems from space.

Weather forecasting has improved dramatically over recent decades.

Modern technology allows meteorologists

to predict weather several days ahead with reasonable accuracy.

However, weather remains somewhat unpredictable,

especially beyond a few days.

Small changes in atmospheric conditions can produce unexpected results.

Different tools help forecast weather.

Radar detects precipitation and shows

where rain or snow is falling.

Weather balloons carry instruments high into the atmosphere

to measure conditions at various altitudes.

Computer models analyze vast amounts of data

to generate predictions.

Understanding forecasts helps people plan activities and prepare for severe weather.

Farmers check forecasts

to decide when

to plant crops or harvest fields.

Airlines use weather information

to plan safe flight routes.

Construction workers need forecasts to schedule outdoor projects.

Weather symbols on forecasts indicate expected conditions - sun icons for clear skies,

clouds for overcast conditions,

rain drops for precipitation.

Temperature predictions help us choose appropriate clothing.

Wind forecasts warn boaters and sailors

about potentially dangerous conditions.

Scientists have noticed

that Earth's climate is gradually changing.

The average temperature around the world is slowly rising.

This change affects weather patterns and can make extreme weather events more frequent and severe.

Climate change differs from normal weather variations.

While weather describes short-term atmospheric conditions,

climate refers

to long-term patterns over decades or centuries.

Global climate change results primarily from human activities releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Evidence of climate change appears in various forms.

Glaciers worldwide are melting and retreating.

Sea levels are rising

as ocean water expands from warming and ice melts.

Some regions experience more intense droughts,

while others face increased flooding.

Heat waves become more frequent and severe.

These changes impact ecosystems and human societies.

Plant and animal species must migrate

to cooler areas or adapt

to changing conditions.

Some species cannot adapt quickly enough and face extinction.

Agriculture becomes more challenging

as traditional growing seasons shift and weather becomes less predictable.

Extreme weather events - hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts,

heat waves - appear

to intensify.

While scientists cannot attribute any single event

to climate change,

the overall pattern suggests increasing severity and frequency.

Coastal communities face particular vulnerability

as rising seas threaten homes and infrastructure.

Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and individual action.

Reducing fossil fuel consumption,

developing renewable energy sources,

protecting forests,

and modifying industrial practices can help slow climate change.

Individuals contribute

through energy conservation,

reducing waste,

supporting sustainable businesses,

and making environmentally conscious choices.

We can help protect our environment by being mindful of our actions.

Using less energy, recycling,

and planting trees are small steps

that can make a difference

when many people do them together.

Each season has its special beauty and characteristics.

Spring brings new life and hope.

Summer offers warmth and long days for fun.

Autumn provides comfortable weather and beautiful colors.

Winter gives us a peaceful,

quiet time

to rest and reflect.

By understanding weather and seasons,

we can better appreciate the natural world around us.

We learn

to adapt

to changes and find joy in each type of weather.

Rain or shine,

hot or cold,

every kind of weather is an important part of nature's cycle.
