Sam : Yuka, have you decided how you're going to spend your summer vacation?
Yuka : Not yet, Sam. I'm planning to travel abroad. I want to go to Paris or Rome, but I can't decide which city to choose.
Sam : Both cities are great to visit. Will it be your first trip to Europe?
Yuka : Yes, I've visited Australia before, but I've never traveled to Europe. Traveling to Europe is expensive. But this summer, I will go there.
Sam : I see. What do you want to do during your trip?
Yuka : Well... I'm interested in history, so I want to visit some historical sites. I want to try local foods, too.
Sam : Are you staying for about two weeks?
Yuka : No, for one week. I wish I could visit the two cities during my trip.
Sam : It may be possible, Yuka. I just checked the Internet and found a plan. In this plan, you can visit both cities. Look.
Yuka : That sounds great. The travel fee is just 10,000 yen higher than my original plan. If I make my travel plan longer, I can enjoy traveling in the two cities.
