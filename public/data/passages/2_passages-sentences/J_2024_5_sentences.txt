Since old times, Japanese people have experienced natural disasters many times.
They cannot be stopped because they come from nature.
When a typhoon is coming, weather reports show us which course the typhoon can take.
However, we cannot stop the typhoon.
Also we cannot tell when and where the next earthquake will happen.
Even the highest technology cannot help us avoid all these natural disasters.
Then what should we do to prepare for natural disasters?
First, we need to get the right information about them.
Look at the graph.
It shows the ways people want to use to get disaster information.
According to the graph, many people want to use TV and radio for disaster information.
More than 80 percent of people chooose TV, and about 48 percent of people choose radio as a useful source.
On the other hand, the graph shows that many people are trying to get the information on the Internet.
More than 35 percent of people of people think that social media give them useful information.
It is also important for us to think of the things we can do now.
Actually, we can do a lot of things to prepare for natural disasters.
For example, many cities have made evacuation maps which show where to go in natural disasters such as big earthquakes.
If we share the maps with our family or our neighbors, we can better.
Since old times, evacuation maps and drills have saved many people from natural disasters.
Nobody can know when and where a natural disaster will happen.
Today, we experience many big natural disasters, but we are too busy with our daily lives to think about them every day.
However, it is important to get the right information and skills to prepare for natural disasters.
