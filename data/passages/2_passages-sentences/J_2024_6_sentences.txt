Yuka, have you decided how you're going to spend your summer vacation?
Not yet, Sam.
I'm planning to travel abroad.
I want to go to Paris or Rome, but I can't decide which city to choose.
Both cities are great to visit.
Will it be your first trip to Europe?
Yes, I've visited Australia before, but I've never traveled to Europe.
Traveling to Europe is expensive.
But this summer, I will go there.
I see.
What do you want to do during your trip?
Well...
I'm interested in history, so I want to visit some historical sites.
I want to try local foods, too.
Are you staying for about two weeks?
No, for one week.
I wish I could visit the two cities during my trip.
It may be possible, Yuka.
I just checked the Internet and found a plan.
In this plan, you can visit both cities.
Look.
That sounds great.
The travel fee is just 10,000 yen higher than my original plan.
If I make my travel plan longer, I can enjoy traveling in the two cities.
