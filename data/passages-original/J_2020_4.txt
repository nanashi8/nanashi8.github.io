Becky : In our city, we have a good zoo, Smile Zoo. The zoo has some interesting events. Let's visit the zoo together next Sunday.
Eiji : Good! I love elephants. Are there any events with the elephants?
Becky : Yes. This is flyer of the zoo. Look. We can give food to them.
Eiji : Oh, that's wonderful. It will start at eleven in the morning, and we can enjoy it for thirty minutes.
Becky : I'm looking forward to the event! Well, I want to watch some animal families.
Eiji : Me, too. Well, the zoo has two events to do that.
Becky : Right, but I can't join Night Safari because I have to go home by six.
Eiji: OK. Then, let's join watching Pandas . Oh, look. We should take our student ID cards to the zoo and show them to tha staff.
Becky : Yes. We are fifteen years old. So, if we do that, our entrance fee will be three dollars per person.
Eiji : That's great. By the way, I have a question. How will we go there ?
Becky : By bus. We'll take abus at the bus stop in front of our school at eight. So, let's meet there at seven fifty in the morning.
