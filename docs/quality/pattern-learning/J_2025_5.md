## 4. 一文訳

- At the start of 2025, new houses and buildings in Tokyo will need to be special.
  2025年の初めに、東京の新しい家や建物は特別なものになる必要があります。
- Do you know what this is?
  これが何か知っていますか？
- They need to have solar panels to make energy.
  それらはエネルギーを作るためにソーラーパネルを持つ必要があります。
- This new law was made to reduce the amount of CO2 and help to slow down global warming.
  この新しい法律は、CO2の量を減らし、地球温暖化を遅らせるのを助けるために作られました。
- Today, I want to talk about the good points and bad points of this new law, and about energy in Japan.
  今日は、この新しい法律の良い点と悪い点、そして日本のエネルギーについて話したいと思います。
- Japan uses two kinds of energy.
  日本は2種類のエネルギーを使っています。
- Non-renewable energy, such as oil and gas, is lost after it is used.
  石油やガスなどの非再生可能エネルギーは、使われた後に失われます。
- They also increase CO2 in the environment.
  それらは環境中のCO2も増やします。
- The other kind is renewable energy.
  もう一つの種類は再生可能エネルギーです。
- This includes wind power, hydropower, and solar power.
  これには風力、水力、太陽光発電が含まれます。
- These can be used again and again, so they help to reduce the amount of CO2 in the air.
  これらは何度も繰り返し使えるので、大気中のCO2の量を減らすのに役立ちます。
- Japan has many mountains and rivers, so hydropower is important.
  日本には多くの山と川があるので、水力発電は重要です。
- However, most places that can make hydropower are already developed.
  しかし、水力発電を作れるほとんどの場所はすでに開発されています。
- So, solar power is becoming more important.
  そのため、太陽光発電がより重要になってきています。
- Please look at the table.
  表を見てください。
- You can see that the percentage of hydropower is almost the same every year, but the percentage of solar power is increasing.
  水力発電の割合は毎年ほぼ同じですが、太陽光発電の割合は増加していることがわかります。
- In 2020, the percentage of solar power was about as large as the percentage of hydropower and wind power combined.
  2020年には、太陽光発電の割合は水力発電と風力発電を合わせた割合とほぼ同じ大きさでした。
- Another interesting thing about solar power in Japan is the technology.
  日本の太陽光発電についてのもう一つの興味深い点は技術です。
- In other countries, large, open spaces are used to build solar farms, but Japan does not have such spaces.
  他の国では、広く開けた空間が太陽光発電所を建てるために使われますが、日本にはそのような空間がありません。
- So, Japan has developed new technology to solve this problem.
  そこで、日本はこの問題を解決するために新しい技術を開発しました。
- For example, farmers build many new solar farms on water.
  例えば、農家は水の上に多くの新しい太陽光発電所を建てています。
- These solar farms float over the water that they use to grow rice.
  これらの太陽光発電所は、米を育てるために使う水の上に浮かんでいます。
- In this way, they lose less water to evaporation in the hot summer and can make money by creating energy.
  このようにして、暑い夏の蒸発による水の損失を減らし、エネルギーを生み出してお金を稼ぐことができます。
- For these reasons, Tokyo passed the new law about solar panels on new houses.
  こうした理由から、東京は新しい家へのソーラーパネル設置についての新しい法律を可決しました。
- Some people are not happy with the new law because they say that solar panels are too expensive to buy.
  ソーラーパネルは購入するには高すぎると言う人もいるため、新しい法律に満足していない人もいます。
- Other people say that, because Tokyo has many tall buildings, the solar panels will not get much light.
  また、東京には多くの高い建物があるため、ソーラーパネルはあまり光を得られないと言う人もいます。
- On the other hand, the government says that solar panels will help to create many new jobs.
  一方、政府はソーラーパネルが多くの新しい雇用を生み出すのに役立つと言っています。
- This is because solar panels must be checked every year.
  それは、ソーラーパネルが毎年点検されなければならないからです。
- It also says that, if each house can save a little energy, it will improve the environment.
  さらに、各家庭が少しのエネルギーを節約できれば、環境を改善するとも言っています。
- I think so, too.
  私もそう思います。
- There are many different ideas to help to reduce CO2.
  CO2を減らすのに役立つさまざまなアイデアがあります。
- We need to work together to make a nice world.
  私たちは素敵な世界を作るために協力する必要があります。
- Thank you for listening.
  聞いてくれてありがとう。
